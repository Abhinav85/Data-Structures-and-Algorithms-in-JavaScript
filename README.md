This repository contains the collection of Data Structures and Algorithm in JavaScript.
Helpful for anyone preparing for Interviews or studying JavaScript. 


The following DataStructures have been added, though I've added some questions only.

Some Questions from the following Algorithms questions have been added too

- Searching

The questions are picked from Random Sites. Also I urge you to please point any error in the code.
I have added a lot of comments for better understanding, but if you feel as if there is any problem
Or the understanding is flawed, please Comment. Any help is very appreciated


*I try to upload one question Daily, to better my understanding. Some errors might creep in.
Please feel free to point out any errors*
